    "# Section 3 - GeoDN Modelling; Running a workflow from the catalogue\n",
    "This example notebook will walk you through the process of running a workflow using a definition already stored in the workflow catalogue.  This is the way that most GeoDN Modeling workflows should be run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run a workflow from the catalogue, a user needs to just specify the parameters available for that workflow.  The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Import packages and specify GeoDN Modeling URLs.\n",
    "2) Grab an authentication token using the GeoDN SDK.\n",
    "3) Create a connection to the GeoDN Modeling Workflow API.\n",
    "4) Browser the available workflows.\n",
    "5) Select a workflow and update the workflow options.\n",
    "6) Send it to the cluster to run.\n",
    "7) Monitor the workflow run status.\n",
    "8) Download and view the output files.\n",
    "9) Check a list of past workflow runs.\n",
